# dats
Compose music in a text editor.


Example:
```
NL 1 C3
NL 4 D3
...
```

# Building
- Assuming you have flex and bison already installed,
dats can be easily build by running make inside the src directory.



To test dats, execute `./dats < example.dats` or `./dats example.dats`.
Both would work anyhow.

## TODO
- [x] Able to export wav files.

- [ ] Add diagnostic message.

- [ ] Able to take arguments (getopt.h)

- [x] Sanity check.
