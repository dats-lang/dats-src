Dats is license under the LGPLv2.1 but there are other software included
that are distributed under different license like the sndfilter. Such
software, when distributed along with Dats, (1) should retain their same
license or (2) sublicense with a compatible one if permissable. This does
not impose additional requirements or restrictions on the distribution
of Dats nor its included 3rd party software, but a recommendation to
the distributors.
