Dats is license under LGPLv2.1 but there are other software that are
distributed under different license like the sndfilter. Such software,
when distributed along with Dats, (1) should retain their same license or
(2) sublicense with a compatible one if permissable. This does not impose
a requirement or a restriction on the distribution of Dats nor its 3rd
party software, but a recommendation to the distributors.
